# JS Test Driven Task List

## Instructions:

For this project, you'll be building out a Task Lister application. We'll be using good OO design patterns to build out our Client Side app. To start, there will be no persistence.  However, you will need three components, one for List(s), Task(s), and an App parent component.  These models will need auto-incrementing IDs as well as some "class" methods.  You will then need write a function to add new lists and add new tasks into the DOM.

## Step 1: Setup

1. Fork this repository.
2. Clone your fork locally.
3. cd into the local repos folder.
4. from your terminal, run `npm test`
5. The tests will be displayed on the page. This app is also hot reloading so every time you save a file, the page will refresh and the tests will re-run in the browser

## Step 2: Models

Next, implement the models for Task and List. A List should have many tasks associated with it.
